## Informative Reading

- Researchers at Amnesty International discovered a [campaign of phishing attacks against a group of people most of whom were involved in the issue of migrants’ rights in Qatar and Nepal](https://medium.com/amnesty-insights/operation-kingphish-uncovering-a-campaign-of-cyber-attacks-against-civil-society-in-qatar-and-aa40c9e08852). Though technically not very sophisticated, the attack was well planned and involved carefully crafted fake social media profiles that connected to the targets and used this trust to learn about them and deliver phishing messages. Social media can be really great to meet people who care about the same cause as you do, but if you handle sensitive information you should be wary of fake profiles trying to connect. As the article puts it: if you wouldn’t share it on Twitter, don’t share information with someone you don’t know, even if it is someone who appears to have friends on social media in common with you.

- Citizen Lab writes about an ongoing [phishing campaign against various Egyptian NGOs](https://citizenlab.org/2017/02/nilephish-report/). Phishing is a technique where users are lured into entering their credentials of for example email, banking or social media accounts. It affects any internet user, but is of particular concern to those targeted by powerful adversaries such as governments. In this case, as was seen in Egypt, the senders already know quite a lot about their target and use this to make the emails that contained the phishing link look very credible. Those who are likely targets of such attacks should be very wary of clicking links in emails they receive; in case of the slightest doubt, they should consult a trusted security expert. To seriously increase the bar for the adversary, two factor authentication should be used for all accounts that give access to important information.

- Claudio and Collin from SWB write about [new malware that targets Apple's Mac OS X](https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/macdownloader-macos-malware/) operating system and that is written by an Iranian group. For everyone, even those not particularly concerned about Iranian actors, this serves as an important reminder that malware on OS X is a reality. Though malware targeting Windows is far more prevalent, Mac users should not consider themselves invincible and apply the same security hygiene as users of other operating systems. This especially applies to those with powerful adversaries. Another example of this was seen when [security researchers found a piece of malware, of unknown origin, that was hidden inside a Word for Mac file](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/these-hackers-cleverly-disguised-their-malware-as-a-document-about-trumps-victory). The malware would be activated when the user enabled macros. It is thus important, in Mac as much as in Windows, to never enable macros in Office files, no matter how much the document says it is needed to view hidden content.

- CitizenLab wrote about the use of [NSO Group exploits to target the mobile devices of a number of Mexican individuals](https://citizenlab.org/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/) all of whom have campaigned for a tax on sugary drinks ("soda tax"). NSO Group malware had previously been used to target UAE-based human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor. This malware, which is exclusively sold to governments, is known to be both very powerful and very stealthy; in practice this means that the usual advice about keeping your devices and software up to date, while still important, is not always good enough. Those who suspect they could be the target of these kinds of attacks are adviced to take extreme caution and look for help locking down their devices. Advanced though the malware was, the infection techniques weren't. The targets recevied a number of SMS messages, each of which contained a link clicking on which would have infected their phone with the malware. Given the targeted nature of the campain, the messages appeared very relevant to the targets. The same technique has been used in many less sophisticated malware and phishing campaigns. It is important to err on the side of caution before opening links sent in messages. In case of doubt, contact the apparent sender of the messages through a different channel. Matters of life and death are rarely, if ever, solved by clicking on a link.
